                <h1 class="subtitle">Goal Alignment & Information Structure</h1>
                <p>
                    My goals when I was designing this website was to create a website that will commmunicate with the user and show them the developer’s perspective about internet art. 
                    I wanted to design an interactive website which allowed the user to navigate smoothly through the pages and feel the pleasing aesthetic given by the images, colours, 
                    and the texts on each page. My other goal was to make the user experience and user interface user-friendly and attractive as well as meaningful by making user all that
                    when the user interacts with each page they connect with the content through the aesthetic appeal. I want the user to see the visual representations used in the website 
                    to communicate meaning like the images and the colour palette and feel a nostalgi feeling. I want them to see how art keeps evolving through the impact of the internet by 
                    looking at how I structured the website and the images I used to complement every content in the website. All I want them to do when they interact with the website is to
                    browse through it with an open mind and have fun reading the content and connecting ith the internet artworks I created. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My target audience is the youth, I want then to learn and have a though about what internet art means to them and how it has changed their lives. Recent generation's focal
                    point is on the internet, with this website I want them to have and be able to share their perspectives on how art is now share using the internet and what influences the internet 
                    has on art. Most of the content I have on the website is based on internet art, net/web art and how the change in how art is criticized. The most important content is how
                    the information we get from what we interact with on the internet shapes and chnages our societal norms. What is most interesting is how one can design art uig the internet and let
                    the audience criticize and analyze it instantly withiout having to interact with the artwork physically. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the viewer browses on the homepage, the first thing I wanted them to see was the design section and the dev blogs section including the weekly blogs and design pages which 
                    are shown via interactive sliders. I also included links on the top right corner of the homepage which will also appear in all the pages, these are the dev blogs link 
                    (showing the user a bit of content that will be included in the weekly blogs, if they want to read more content all they have to do is click on the “more” link to move to the next page), 
                    internet art(s) link (showing the user the different types of internet arts that will be in the website and all they have to do to look at the internet art thoroughly is click 
                    on the image to move to the internet art page they want), web design link (showing a little bit of content on the design pages i.e., wireframes, style guide, implementation notes, and IxD process), 
                    and the homepage link which will take the user to the homepage of the website.
                </p>

                <p>The mindmap shows the information I want to display on all the pages in the website.</p>
                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="../images/Mindmap.png" alt="Mindmap">
                        <aside>
                            <p>
                                For the homepage design I decided to use sliders to show the design and blogs sections, because I want the viewer’s attention to go there when they open the website as they both hold most of the website’s 
                                important content. The sliders include four cards each with an image, link to the blog page, the name, and date, the image displayed on each card will be corresponding with the content the page gives, 
                                I made this decision because I want to make it easy for the reader to see and have an idea of what the content of that specific page is based on through looking at the image before reading the title, 
                                and to keep the consistency in the page. I used a background image that gives the digital art aesthetic because the website is about the innovation of art using evolving technology. 
                                I then included a footer on each page on the website to make the user be able to access all the links to other pages without having to browse back up on the pages to access them, 
                                the footer also has a form which allows the user to give feedback about the content the interacted with on every page. I made sure I keep the content of all the pages in the middle of 
                                the page to keep the structure or layout of the pages consistent. 
                            </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">User Flow and Interface Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    The navigation for the website will be smooth and easy as the user will have all the links to the pages available for them to move from one page to another without 
                    having to go back and forth to the homepage. Below I have attached the user flow diagram demontrating some of the choices the user may make and actions when navigating through the 
                    website.
                </p>

                <caption>User Flow Diagram</caption></figure>

                <p>
                    For the interface elements, in terms of the navigational components I used sliders for the homepage, pagination for every page, icons for to signify what the specific text is 
                    based on. Tags showing what a certain image is signifying, hyperlinks to show the links. For input controls I used buttons for the scroller and the send button in the foorter when the user is done writing 
                    their feedback if interested, I used a date field in the sliders to show when each blog was written, then I used toggles to make the navigation easy for the user to move between
                    the pages. The information components then include the use of icons, and a dialogue box for the user to read additinonal information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Design and Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the UI and UX, I wanted the user to have fun, feel keen to know what information other web pages hold, and express their emotions by giving feedback. 
                        For the presented user interface, I will briefly explain my design choices focusing on four aspects of the visual representation: typography, colour, graphics, and layout.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Typography</span>: I used Times New Roman for the font because it is legible and spacious, it gives the reader a coherent text to engage with. Most people are familiar with it because it is an old font, it is neat and easy to read. 
                        I used different font sizes to suit the layout and to differentiate between texts like showing which one is the heading, this is because the reader will not be confused about where to start reading and what the content is about 
                        since headings can give the reader an insight of what they are going to read about. I also used different font weights to specify which text holds important information.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Colour</span>: I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh and easy to look at, I used about six colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
                        white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey, and dark green. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
                        I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance like the captions in the slider cards, also to avoid the text blending into the background images.
                        I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like when the user hover on the links in the header. 
                        Grey was used as the background colour in the footer to show the balance between the information in the body section and the footer section. Light pink and cream white were used for some subheadings and as the hovering colour on the socials because I wanted to give the text some 
                        youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out and show some stability and balance in the text, 
                        also a dark green background shows when the user hovers in the links to the home, data visualization, and data-art pages to show the user that they can move to the pages without hesitations and see the importance of each link. All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, 
                        they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.
                    </p>
               
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Graphics</span>: I used images from unsplash.com for the background images and images in the slider cards on the home page. I chose to use these images for aesthetic appeal and attraction. I resized and compressed the images so that they do not take too much space, and don't 
                        take time to load when the website starts to show information. I used simple and light images as possible, to bring the peaceful and calming aesthetic when the user navigates through the pages, and to ensure that the text does not blend in. Then I included graphics that I designed myself like 
                        on the wireframes page and the diagrams that show the user interface interaction flow.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Layout</span>: I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. The style guide, critical reflections, and blog posts almost have the same layout because 
                        they contain a lot of text without any illustrations, so I kept the layout simple. The home page and the wireframes page have slider displays to show the content, I chose these layouts because the content includes images and carried a lot of important information for the user to pay close attention to. 
                        Also, the layout enables effortless navigation through the page and makes it more attractive.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        My UI and UX thus far are well done, and I am working to implement them more and bring better changes to the design using the feedback I am yet to receive. The user interface of the website should have an intellectual, spiritual, and emotional connection with the user; 
                        the functionality and usability of the website must be investigated more through prototypes and wireframes to end up with a design with good UI and UX.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started the design process by designing the wireframes aiming to show my initial ideas, see illustrations and explanations below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="../images/BlogPages.png" alt="Blog pages wireframe">
                        <aside>

                            <p>
                                I chose this layout because the information will be neatly presented and readable with a simple navigation.
                            </p>
                        </aside>
                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="../images/Homepage.png" alt="Homepage wireframe">
                        <aside>

                            <p>
                                The layout allows users to have options to navigate to other pages including links and sliders. 
                                The interface will include images to make it attractive. The left and right arrows will be buttons to allow the 
                                user to move the slider cards. I chose this layout because it will keep the content in order and the user will have 
                                a clear understanding when they navigate the page that they are on the homepage.

                                I chose this layout because I want the art to be well presented and make the image be spacious and clear.

                            <p>
                                I chose the same layout as the blog posts’ page because the page will include a lot of information that I want to keep legible and spaciously presented. 
                                It will include critical writing of my style choices and reasons behind the choices as well as how these choices have or had impacts on the design.

                                More like the style guide page, it will include reflections on the design process and reasons behind my design choices.
                            </p>

                                The layout will have illustrations with supporting captions on the side, I chose it because it will present the 
                                content legibly. I want the page to show all the design choices I made and the reasons behind then while being 
                                spacious and readable.

                                I went for the slider layout to keep the content in one place and let the user have time to look at the 
                                wireframes slide-by-slide. I chose this type of layout because there will not be too much text on the page, and the wireframes have enough information on their own.
