                <p>
                    My goals when I was designing this website was to create a website that will commmunicate with the user and show them the developer’s perspective about internet art. 
                    I wanted to design an interactive website which allowed the user to navigate smoothly through the pages and feel the pleasing aesthetic given by the images, colours, 
                    and the texts on each page. My other goal was to make the user experience and user interface user-friendly and attractive as well as meaningful by making user all that
                    when the user interacts with each page they connect with the content through the aesthetic appeal. I want the user to see the visual representations used in the website 
                    to communicate meaning like the images and the colour palette and feel a nostalgi feeling. I want them to see how art keeps evolving through the impact of the internet by 
                    looking at how I structured the website and the images I used to complement every content in the website. All I want them to do when they interact with the website is to
                    browse through it with an open mind and have fun reading the content and connecting ith the internet artworks I created. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My target audience is the youth, I want then to learn and have a though about what internet art means to them and how it has changed their lives. Recent generation's focal
                    point is on the internet, with this website I want them to have and be able to share their perspectives on how art is now share using the internet and what influences the internet 
                    has on art. Most of the content I have on the website is based on internet art, net/web art and how the change in how art is criticized. The most important content is how
                    the information we get from what we interact with on the internet shapes and chnages our societal norms. What is most interesting is how one can design art uig the internet and let
                    the audience criticize and analyze it instantly withiout having to interact with the artwork physically. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the viewer browses on the homepage, the first thing I wanted them to see was the design section and the dev blogs section including the weekly blogs and design pages which 
                    are shown via interactive sliders. I also included links on the top right corner of the homepage which will also appear in all the pages, these are the dev blogs link 
                    (showing the user a bit of content that will be included in the weekly blogs, if they want to read more content all they have to do is click on the “more” link to move to the next page), 
                    internet art(s) link (showing the user the different types of internet arts that will be in the website and all they have to do to look at the internet art thoroughly is click 
                    on the image to move to the internet art page they want), web design link (showing a little bit of content on the design pages i.e., wireframes, style guide, implementation notes, and IxD process), 
                    and the homepage link which will take the user to the homepage of the website.
                </p>

                <p>The mindmap shows the information I want to display on all the pages in the website.</p>

                        <aside>
                            <p>
                                For the homepage design I decided to use sliders to show the design and blogs sections, because I want the viewer’s attention to go there when they open the website as they both hold most of the website’s 
                                important content. The sliders include four cards each with an image, link to the blog page, the name, and date, the image displayed on each card will be corresponding with the content the page gives, 
                                I made this decision because I want to make it easy for the reader to see and have an idea of what the content of that specific page is based on through looking at the image before reading the title, 
                                and to keep the consistency in the page. I used a background image that gives the digital art aesthetic because the website is about the innovation of art using evolving technology. 
                                I then included a footer on each page on the website to make the user be able to access all the links to other pages without having to browse back up on the pages to access them, 
                                the footer also has a form which allows the user to give feedback about the content the interacted with on every page. I made sure I keep the content of all the pages in the middle of 
                                the page to keep the structure or layout of the pages consistent. 
                            </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">User Flow and Interface Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    The navigation for the website will be smooth and easy as the user will have all the links to the pages available for them to move from one page to another without 
                    having to go back and forth to the homepage. Below I have attached the user flow diagram demontrating some of the choices the user may make and actions when navigating through the 
                    website.
