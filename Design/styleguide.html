                    <h1 class="subject">Font</h1>
                    <p>
                    I used Times New Roman from the font-family for the text in all the pages, because a lot of people are familiar with it since it is an old font,
                    and it is used in many texts such as word documents, also because it is neat and easy to read as well as understand, and it has an economy of space for the reader to engage with a coherent text and be attracted to it at first glance. I used different
                    font-sizes to best suit the layout, depending on how long the information is and to show which text is the heading or the subtitle, then I used different font-weights to specify which texts hold more important information to consider or pay attention to while reading.
                    Most importantly I used this font family so that the web pages would have space, legibility, and order so that the reader neither gets confused on where to start reading nor finds it hard to digest the information.

                    <h2 class="subject">Graphics</h2>
                    <p>
                        I used images from <a class="link" href="h-card">unsplash.com</a> for the background of the pages, this time around I did not use the unviverse images, I downloaded two images to use as my background images and resized/compressed them so that they do not take time to load on the page. 
                        I made the homepage have its own specific background image because I want the user to feel that they are in the homepage, then I made all the other pages have the same background image to keep the consistency.  I chose to use these images for the backgrounds to make
                        the pages attractive and appealing. I used light and simple images for the pages so that the black text does not blend into the background and make it difficult for the user to read the information.
                        Other graphics I included are the images in the internet art page and the ones I drew using Krita illustrating the user flow and mind map diagrams, I also designed illustrations of the wireframes to explore the user experience of the website in the wireframes page.
                        The homepage has images in the slideshow to illustrate what the content of the pages will be and for aesthetic appeal.

                    <h3 class="subject">Color</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh and easy to look at, I used about six colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
                        white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey, and dark green. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
                        I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance like the captions in the slider cards, also to avoid the text blending into the background images.
                        I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like when the user hover on the links in the header. 
                        Grey was used as the background colour in the footer to show the balance between the information in the body section and the footer section. Light pink and cream white were used for some subheadings and as the hovering colour on the socials because I wanted to give the text some 
                        youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out and show some stability and balance in the text, 
                        also a dark green background shows when the user hovers in the links to the home, data visualization, and data-art pages to show the user that they can move to the pages without hesitations and see the importance of each link. All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, 
                        they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.

                    <h4 class="subject">Layout</h4>
                    <p>
                    I decided to keep everything simple and make the visuals eye-catchy, hence I used images for the 
                    background on each page and used images on the slideshow cards to complement the content that the page holds, I kept the text simple and used appropriate words to convey the information easily.
                    My aim for this website was to ensure a smooth flow of the content on each page, from the homepage to the last one; there is readability, coherence, and order in the blog posts; I narrowed the paragraphs so that the user does not have to 
                    look across the entire width of the screen as a typewriter. I added more pages to the website to show improvement and development from when I first started the project, these are "All blog pages" page where I want the user to have access to all the blog posts in the website and have a little bit of 
                    information shared with them about the content in the page rather that just having the slideshow to do that by only showing the title and date of the blog post. "WebDesign" page where the user will see a bit of content about all the pages in the design section.
                    For the homepage I decided to use the auto play slideshow to display the weekly blog post section (week 3, 4, 5, 6, and reflection writing), which has a complementary image with the information
                    in the blog, name of the author, and the date the post was posted and the web design section (wireframes, planning documentation, styleguide, revised wireframes, and revised styleguide), which included, a complementary image as well and a link to the page. 
                    I went for this layout because I wanted to keep the interface attractive and make it easy for the user to navigate through the it and choose the page they would like to access effortlessly. I made sure that I include links to important content on each page, in the footer and the header,
                    so that the user does not have to navigate back to the homepage to access the links to pages they want to engage with. I used the same layout for each blog post, the styleguide, IxD process, and implementation notes and made the wireframe page have a slideshow to make the viewer browse the page by pressing on the buttons to view the 
                    different wireframes that show the ideas I had for the user experience and user interface.
