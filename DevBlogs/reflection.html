                    Nothing much is interesting when it comes to net/ web art. The reason behind us not finding interest or seeing 
                    the aesthetic appeal in it could be because it is now considered unpleasing. According to Danae, 
                    web art is an art that was produced a long time ago and it is now considered old-fashioned because of the 
                    "post-internet art" which is more interactive and attractive. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We live in a time where everything is forever changing, and change is good! With all this change and growth going on, 
                    what we are taking into consideration at the moment is how this change and innovation of technologies influence our social interactions. 
                    These social interactions are somehow constructed by how we interact with the information we get, especially from the internet, 
                    and now that that information can also be shared through artworks is just mind-blowing. Now, since web art is the way of sharing artworks on the internet, 
                    this means a copy of the artwork will be what is displaying and what the audience will be criticizing, this makes me think of whether 
                    the copy of the artwork on the internet carries more value and aesthetic than the physical original artwork. 
                    The art moving from traditional art to digital art will have a better detail than it would in person as the algorithms of the internet can make it look better. 
                    This means the spectator will analyze the art on the internet differently than they would in person.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Art is being influenced by the internet, what I mean by this statement is that the way we would analyze it in person will not be the same way we would analyze it on the internet. 
                    Although we can understand an artwork by just looking at it, looking at it on the internet will not give us the same understanding of the message behind it as we would get when 
                    we looked at it in person. To explain this further when a person goes to a museum or art gallery, they can have a deeper understanding of the art better as some artists can allow 
                    people to feel the texture of their artworks when they interpret them, physical touch can make the person feel like they are connected to the art in some way and have an experience. 
                    On the other hand, viewing art on the internet cannot be the same experience because you will only see an image of it and not the "real" art (this is if the art has an original artwork), 
                    as digital technologies keep on innovating there will be copies of copies of copies of the artwork, and this might make the artwork lose its worth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a video I was watching on YouTube which explains how art transforms the internet, I will include the link below, I was interested in what the narrator said, 
                    "the same way a text can mean different things in different contexts is the same way art can mean different things in different contexts", 
                    now to think about this does that mean the meaning of the art can also change by interpreting it on the internet? I guess the meaning will remain the same, for example, 
                    if it's a painting of a flower, we will still see an image of a flower on the internet, the only difference when it comes to our brains making meaning of what we are seeing 
                    will be "this is a painting of a flower" and "this is an image of a painting of a flower". The meaning can be easy to understand but the message will require deeper understanding and 
                    I believe the internet may not reach that level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I consider art to be influenced by and about the internet, this is because digital art which in this case is artworks that are designed digitally like web art and they are designed using code, 
                    helps us understand the algorithms of the internet, most of the art about the internet which is the art that cannot exist without the internet's existence does not make sense. 
                    This can mostly be because the designers want to show us what influence code can have on art in terms of producing it, the video below give an insight into this
