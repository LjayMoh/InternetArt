                    Watching the revision videos made me realize that there were many things that I didn't consider, 
                    simple things like using the 'const' variable being much safer than using the 'let' variable in JavaScript. 
                    I did not watch all the videos because I felt like watching them without putting what I was taught into action was a slight waste of time. 
                    I will go back to watching the videos again when I start creating my website, as there will probably be places where I will need to 
                    go back to get clarity on some of the coding.

                    I do not have questions for this week's work, but what I found interesting was the conversation around art about the internet, 
                    art on the internet, art using the internet, and the internet as art. I found this interesting because it made me think a bit about how art is influenced by the internet, 
                    and how it keeps on being influenced by new digital technologies. Artists now have to engage with the internet for them to be able to showcase or share their artworks, 
                    the web makes it easy for everyone to interact with the artists' artworks without physically analyzing or admiring them. 
                    I think art after the internet is much easier to connect with as the internet makes it easy for artists to interact with one another and share their artworks with different people around the world, 
                    as David Carrier stated in his reading, "the natural home of art criticism is now the internet, ..." (2020), meaning the internet is a platform for everyone 
                    to display their work and let it be critiqued immediately. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing that I do not find interesting about net art is that it is not that interactive as it does not have a user interface, although it shows art on the internet, 
                    users cannot interact effectively with the art rather than just browsing through it. I like that it makes us access art that cannot exist without the internet's existence and 
                    shows us art that was produced back in the old times. Overall, I found web art interesting to read about because it makes us understand the history of art done by activists and 
                    how this art impacted social interactions that people constructed back then, as well as how they are constructed in the present.
