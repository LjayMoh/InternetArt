                    Innovation changes a lot of things in our daily lives, it changes how we think, how we communicate, how we interact, 
                    and how we navigate through life. Every piece of information we digest shapes our society, thus new information or technologies impact our social norms, 
                    meaning what we consider as 'normal' changes and we have to adapt to that change. The journal article by Mailloux touches on how innovations come as a 
                    surprise to the people and the medium (1983: 399), this means that people always get shocked when they interact with innovations as this influences their 
                    social norms which in this case we can refer to as "social conventions" (Mailloux, 1983: 400), these conventions are behaviors which the society sees as normal and 
                    how everyone should act regularly. The innovation then comes as a shock to the medium as it will have new algorithms which will impact how the system works and 
                    how people will interpret and interact with it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Internet art keeps innovating as well, and this has an impact on both mediums, these are the internet and art. Art shows us the algorithms of the internet, 
                    while the internet gives us the idea/message of the art, as I had explained in last week's blog that the way we interpret or critique art on the internet will 
                    not be the same as we would in person, the interpretation is based on context. Context according to Alpers in Mailloux refers to a term that 
                    "points out the differences not recognized by conventions" (1983: 404), from my perspective this means that conventions focus only on acceptable human behavior and 
                    what society considers normal while context focuses on what influences how people behave in terms of the situations they find themselves in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I found the reading interesting because it also explains different conventions and how they apply to our daily lives, these are traditional conventions that 
                    determine the repetition of behaviors that end up considered as the way people are supposed to act, social conventions which are almost the same as 
                    traditional conventions as they involve regular actions and shared human behaviors in the society, prescriptive conventions which are behaviors that people feel 
                    they have to adjust to, and interpretive conventions which are behaviors that let people share their opinions about things they interact with or situations 
                    they find themselves in (Mailloux, 1983: 401-405).

                    The idea I have for my internet art is to design something like a collage where I will display images of text, places, people, clothes, etc. 
                    I want the artwork to give a fun aesthetic feel and make the viewer relate to it. I would like the display or interface to look like #PAYBACKTiME
