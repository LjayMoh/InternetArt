                    Benedetta Ricci defines internet art as “a form of art specifically conceived through the internet, on the internet, 
                    and for the internet.” (2020:2), from this definition the art created is digital art, which is art designed using the internet’s algorithms. 
                    Art on the internet is art that was not created using the internet but is displayed and shared via the internet, like taking a photograph of 
                    a painting and sharing in on the internet for people to criticize without having to go to the studio in person. Art for the internet is art 
                    can only be found on the internet, it is art about the internet showing the algorithms of the internet and how they can impact and produce art.
                    The information shared to us through internet art is to show people that they can also create art using the internet without the use of traditional tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For us to understand what art really is and how it functions we have to look back at its history and understand how it all started by analyzing the roots of it. 
                    Art has been around for a very long time before the internet was innovated, and this innovation of the internet made accessibility of art smooth and connected artists 
                    from all over the world by allowing them to share their work online. The thing that makes internet art is the inventions of new technologies, 
                    people design and interpret art using technology then share it on the internet for everyone else to interact with it virtually. Some of the art can be art from ancient times
                    which people did not know existed, some can be art we know existed but was unreachable due to it being in museums or studios in other countries, 
                    and some of the art can be new art which was designed using code or software.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dean shows us that art on the internet can also be used to show us economic and political issues that are going on around the world (2019).
                    This shows the importance of the internet in our societies, it makes us stay alert of the situations that are going on in the world and makes us keep learning, it connects us virtually.
                    Internet art can be used as a platform to recreate ancient art so that it lives forever to show coming generations the history of art and teach them about their traditions and cultures. 
                    The age of the internet art has changed the way we share and access information, by changing the way people interpret what they see on the internet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can conclude that the internet has changed the way we interact and criticize art, by this I mean we now have the chance to view artworks at different studios or museums
                    through the internet besides going to there in person. Art is used to express and share the artists emotions and life experiences, and since we can’t find a stable definition of what art is, 
                    we can thereof say that everything the is evolving around us is art. The internet then makes it easy for us to access the art and have information about it, this information then shapes and 
                    changes our society from generation to generation.
