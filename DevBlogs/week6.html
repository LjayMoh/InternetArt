                <p>
                    We all know that is hard to point what is art and what is not, meaning defining what art is can 
                    be a bit complex as it does not have a stable definition. For this reason s I mentioned in the previus blog we 
                    can therefore consider eveything that is around us as art. Internet art does not just pop out of nowhere of cause,
                    it needs what I can say is a "support system", a foundation which no one sees but the programmer and this is what 
                    we can refer to here as code art. As we can see from the term that there two different terms that mean different thing depending on how one 
                    defines them. According to Oxford Dictionary the term code is defined as “a system of words, letters, figures, or symbols used to represent others, 
                    especially for the purposes of secrecy”, drawing from this definition we can thereof say that code is a way of giving out 
                    information using symbols or digits in a simple form to convey a certain meaning. It is used to communicate meaning using a different platform, like 
                    converting the words found in a novel into simple and short symbols to create art. Looking at this definition we can then see code as art because
                    it a language artists or programmers use to express themselves and explore new innovations.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now if we look at the relationship between code and art we can see that they are both used to convey meaning and 
                    give out information in a certain form using signals/symbols. The code is used by artists to create the art and convey their ideas.
                    What the audience sees is not the code that produced the artwork but they see the artwork itself, meaning they do not interact with 
                    the algorithms of the art but the user interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Code art has different programming languages artists use to create art such as JavaScript, HTML, C++, C#, CSS, etc., 
                    which are used for the creativity of different artworks such as websites that have interactivity. All these languages are
                    used to make internet art come to live. For the artists to get better at them they have to explore and experiment by coding 
                    every chance they get to come up with new ideas and algorithms. Programmers express themselves through coding the same way an 
                    artist can express themselves through art, they communicate and share information through the coded art.

                    “Code art is fundamentally different as it is a native of technology” (Lardner, 2018), code art is different from photography 
                    as it does not need to adapt to the new innovations of technology.
